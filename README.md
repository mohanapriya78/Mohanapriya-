📁 Titanic Survival Prediction Project
🎯 Objective:
To understand and prepare the Titanic dataset for building a predictive machine learning model. This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing values and outliers, and drawing inferences from visualizations.

✅ Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
🔍 Goals:
Handle missing values appropriately.
Treat outliers to prevent distortion in modeling.
Perform initial data checks.
📌 Key Steps:
Loaded the Titanic dataset.
Handled Missing Values:
Cabin filled with 'Unknown'.
Age and Fare filled with median values.
Outlier Detection & Removal:
Detected using boxplots for Age and Fare.
Removed entries where Fare > 300 and Age > 80.
🧹 Outcome:
Dataset cleaned and ready for exploratory analysis.
Missing values and outliers no longer distort the feature distributions.
✅ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔍 Goals:
Analyze data distributions and relationships between features.
Use visualizations to infer patterns and trends.
📊 Key Steps:
Generated Summary Statistics:

Mean, median, standard deviation helped understand spread.
Plotted Visuals:

Histograms for Age and Fare.
Boxplots to detect outliers.
Bar plots comparing Survived with Sex and Pclass.
Correlation Heatmap to find relationships between numeric features.
Pairplot visualizing feature relationships by Survived.
Handled Categorical Encoding:

Used one-hot encoding for categorical features (Sex, Embarked, etc.).
🧠 Inference Summary (From Visuals):
Survival Rate by Sex: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
Survival Rate by Class: 1st class passengers had better survival odds.
Fare: Right-skewed; higher fares generally linked to survival.
Age: Most passengers were 20–40 years old; survival scattered across ages.
Correlation: Strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare; moderate positive correlation between SibSp and Parch.
🧾 Conclusion:
Through systematic data cleaning and insightful EDA:

We understood the data better and prepared it for modeling.
Identified key features impacting survival.
This foundation will support better feature engineering and model accuracy in the next task.
